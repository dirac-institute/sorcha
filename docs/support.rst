Reporting Issues, Proposing Changes, and Contributing
======================================================

.. tip::
   Something not working? Have you checked the :ref:`troubleshooting` page to see if your problem is covered there?

Contributions are very welcome. If there is a feature or functionality not yet available in Sorcha, we encourage you to propose the feature or share your code with the new enhancements. 

Submitting a Github Issue
---------------------------
The best way to get in touch about a bug, suggest enhancements to Sorcha, or recommend changes to the documentation is raise an issue through the `project's github repository <https://github.com/dirac-institute/sorcha/issues>`_. We have a small team working on the project, so please be patient, while we get back to you.

Contributing to Sorcha
---------------------------

We welcome upgrades/bug fixes to the code, This can be done by opening a pull request in the `main Sorcha github repository <https://github.com/dirac-institute/sorcha>`_. If you have new classes that provide enhanced light curve or activity estimations, we welcome pull requests to the `Sorcha Community Utils github repository <https://github.com/dirac-institute/sorcha_community_utils>`_.

You will need to install sorcha from the source code via pip in editable mode as described in the :ref:`installation` page.

.. note::
   We recommend that if you are planning to submit a pull request with enhancements to raise a `github issue in the main sorcha repository <https://github.com/dirac-institute/sorcha/issues>`_ first to discuss further before submitting a pull request.
