Reporting Issues, Proposing Changes, and Contributing
======================================================

.. tip::
   Is something not working? Have you checked the :ref:`troubleshooting` page to see if your problem is covered there?

Contributions are very welcome. If there is a feature or functionality not yet available in ``Sorcha``, we encourage you to propose the feature or share your code with the new enhancements. 

Submitting a GitHub Issue
---------------------------
The best way to get in touch about a bug, suggest enhancements to ``Sorcha``, or recommend changes to the documentation is raise an issue through the `project's GitHub repository <https://github.com/dirac-institute/sorcha/issues>`_. We have a small team working on the project, so please be patient while we get back to you.

Contributing Code
-----------------------------------

We welcome upgrades/bug fixes to the code. This can be done by opening a pull request in the main ``Sorcha`` `GitHub repository <https://github.com/dirac-institute/sorcha>`_. If you have new classes that provide enhanced light curve or activity estimations, we welcome pull requests to the ``Sorcha Add-ons`` `GitHub repository <https://github.com/dirac-institute/sorcha-addons>`_.

You will need to install ``Sorcha`` from the source code via pip in editable mode as described in the :ref:`installation` page.

.. note::
   If you are planning to submit a pull request with enhancements, please raise a `GitHub issue in the main sorcha repository <https://github.com/dirac-institute/sorcha/issues>`_ first to discuss further with the ``Sorcha`` team.


Contributing to the  Documentation
--------------------------------------

We are very happy to receive feedback on the online documentation through the `project's GitHub repository <https://github.com/dirac-institute/sorcha/issues>`_. Beyond pointing out typos and small changes through issues, we welcome pull requests on the `sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/#user-guides>`_ documentation used here on the readthedocs.

You will need to install the development version of ``Sorcha`` from a clone of the ``Sorcha`` repository as well as the `Sorcha Add-ons package <https://github.com/dirac-institute/sorcha-addons>`_. See the our  :ref:`dev_mode` instructions for further details. 


If you move to the docs directory (cd sorcha/docs/), edit the .rst files, and run::

   make html

You will find the generated index.html file in  ../_readthedocs/html/
