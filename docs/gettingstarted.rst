Getting Started
=====================

In this tutorial, we will show you how to setup and run a basic simulation using Sorcha. 

.. tip::
   In this tutorial,  we demonstrate how to run a single instance of Sorcha. Sorcha is designed to allow multiple instances to be run in parallel in order to accomodate simulations with very large numbers of synthetic planetesimals by breaking up the job across multiple live proccesses. We recommend first starting with the examples below, before moving on to parallel processing.


.. important::
  All the input files and configuration files used in this demonstation are available in the demo directory(sorcha/demo). We provide the contents of these files and the links below to download each. You can also grab them in one go by downloading the Sorcha source code repository (Steps 1-4 **only**  of :ref:`dev_mode`).

.. note::
  All input data files in this example are white-space separated format solely for the ease of reading.   

Creating the Orbit and Physical Parameter Files For the Synthetic Solar System Populations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first step in the process is to generate a set of files which describe the orbital and physical parameters
of our synthetic Solar System population that we wish to input into the simulator. 

Making the Orbit File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, we will start with creating an :ref:`orbits`, and generate a file called 'sspp_testset_orbits.des', which contains the orbits of five synthetic objects. You can download the file from `here <https://github.com/dirac-institute/sorcha/blob/main/demo/sspp_testset_orbits.des>`__. The contents of the file is below:

.. literalinclude:: ../demo/sspp_testset_orbits.des
    :language: text

Make the Physical Parameters File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next, we need to produce the :ref:`physical`, which we call 'sspp_testset_colours.txt'. This file assigns colors, phase curve properties, and absolute mangitudes to each of the simulated small bodies whose orbits are defined in our input orbit file. You can download the file from `here <https://github.com/dirac-institute/sorcha/blob/main/demo/sspp_testset_colours.txt>`__.  The contents of the file is below:

.. literalinclude:: ../demo/sspp_testset_colours.txt
    :language: text

.. note::
  For this tutorial, we have defined chosen the main filter to be r-band. In the following configuration file, we wil list the r filter first when we have to input ourlist of filters to use. 

Getting the Pointing Database 
------------------------------------------
For this tutorial, we're using the first year of the baseline v2.0 LSST cadence simulation as the :ref:`pointing`. You can download the file from `here <https://github.com/dirac-institute/sorcha/blob/main/demo/baseline_v2.0_1yr.db>`__.


Setting Up Sorcha's Configuration File 
------------------------------------------

The key information about the simulation paramteres are held in the configuration file. For further details check out our :ref:`configs` page. We'll be using the configuration file we have set up to get you started. You can download the file from `here <https://github.com/dirac-institute/sorcha/blob/main/demo/PPConfig_test.ini>`__. The contents of the file is below: 

.. literalinclude:: ../demo/PPConfig_test.ini
    :language: text

.. note::
  For this tutorial, we have set up Sorcha to only find detections on g,r,i, or z filter observations, by what we have set the **observing_filters** parameter to. Since we specified the absolute magnitude and colors for our synthetic objects to r-band, the rfilter starts the list of filters for  **observing_filters**.

.. note::
   This config file sdets the  output to be in CSV format.   


Running Sorcha
----------------------

We now have all the required input files. If you downloaded the Sorcha repository, start by moving into the sorcha directory or make a demo directory called **demo** and move/copy all the input files into there. 

Next, let's take a look at the command line arguments for sorcha. On the command line, typing::

   sorcha --help 

will produce

.. literalinclude:: ./example_files/help_output.txt 
    :language: text

Now that you know how to provide the input files, let's go run a simulation::

   sorcha -c ./demo/PPConfig_test.ini -p ./demo/sspp_testset_colours.txt -ob ./demo/sspp_testset_orbits.des -e ./demo/example_oif_output.txt -pd ./demo/baseline_v2.0_1yr.db -o ./ -t testrun_e2e

.. tip::
   Sorcha outputs a log file (*.sorcha.log) and error file (*.sorcha.err) in the output directory. If all has gone well, the error file will be empty. The log file has the configuration parameters outputted to it as a record of the run setup.

The output will appear in a csv file (testrun_e2e.csv) in your current directory. The first 51 lines of the csv file should look something like this:

.. literalinclude:: ../docs/example_files/testrun_e2e.csv
    :language: text
    :lines: 1-51

.. note:: The values will not be exactly the same because of the different random number generator seed applied each time Sorcha runs. We use the random generator to adjust the calculated values to be within the measurement precision/uncertainty both in position (RA/Dec) and apparent magnitude.  

.. tip::
   If you want to run this command a second time you'll need to add a **-f** flag to the command line to force overwriting output files that already were exist in the output directory. Do note that the previous run's log and error log files will not be removed. New log files are generated at each run.  

.. warning::
   Only one instance of Sorcha should be run per output directory to ensure that distict log and error files are created for each Sorcha run. Make sure to have different output pathways if you are running multiple instances on the same compute node.

.. note::
   This test run is using pre-generated ephemeris already stored in the demo directory of the Sorcha github repository.
