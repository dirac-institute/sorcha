Advanced User Features
==========================

.. danger::
   **If you're new to** ``Sorcha`` **turn away from this section NOW! We're only partially kidding.** This section provides information about features for advanced users of ``Sorcha``. Changing or adjusting the parameters described in this section may produce unintended results. **With great power comes great responsibility. Be very careful in applying the knowledge below.** For many use cases, a user will likely not need to touch these parameters within ``Sorcha``.

Setting the Random Number Generator Seed
---------------------------------------------

The value used to seed the random number generator can be specified via the **SORCHA_SEED** environmental variable. This allows for ``Sorcha`` to be fully reproducibly run with (if using a bash shell or Z-shell)::

   export SORCHA_SEED=52

.. tip::
   If you're trying to reproduce a crash or a certain behavior in ``Sorcha``, you can find the value that you need to set the random seed to in the log file.  

.. warning::
   For most science cases, you **DO NOT** want to set the same seed for each ``Sorcha`` run, but if you need reproducibility then you will want to set the random number generator seed environment variable before running ``Sorcha``        


Expert User Filters and Config File Options
-----------------------------------------------

The following options can be optionally applied via changes to the ``Sorcha`` :ref:`configs`. 

 
Turning Vignetting Off 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, :ref:`vignetting<vignetting>` using LSSTCam parameters is applied. To turn vignetting off, add to the :ref:`configs`::

   [EXPERT]
   vignetting_on = False

.. note::
   If vignetting is turned off, then the 5Ïƒ Limiting Magnitude at the Source Location will be the limiting magnitude at the center of the camera FOV (field-of-view) from the :ref:`pointing`.
 
.. tip::
   Vignetting is a small effect for the LSSTCam, so you will see only a modest change in results if you turn this off for LSST simulations


Turning Off the Randomization of the Magnitude and Astrometry Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There may be a reason that you want to turn off the :ref:`randomization<randomization>` of the trailed source magnitude and PSF magnitude as well as the RA and Dec values::

   [EXPERT]
   randomization_on = False


Turning Off Trailing Losses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Applying :ref:`trailing losses<trailing>` is on by default, but it can be turned off by including the option in the :ref:`configs`::

    [EXPERT]
    trailing_losses_on = False

.. warning::
    We **very strongly recommend** that the user never turn this off, but we provide
    this option for debugging or for speed increases when the user is absolutely sure
    they are only supplying slow-moving objects.

.. note::
   If trailing losses are not applied, then for each potential input population detection ``Sorcha`` will set the PSF magnitude equal to the calculated trailed source magnitude. 

Turning off Detection Efficiency/Applying the Fading Function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`survey detection efficiency<fading>` is disabled if the fading function ([FADINGFUNCTION]) section of the :ref:`configs` is removed or not included (when **fading_function_width** and **fading_function_peak_efficiency** have not been provided).

Turning Off the Camera Footprint Filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In rare instances you may need to skip the :ref:`camera footprint filter<footprint>` and turn it off. This can be done by setting the camera model to none in the field-of-view (FOV) section of the :ref:`configs`::

    [FOV]
    camera_model = none

.. note::
    If you're using ``Sorcha``'s built-in :ref:`ephemeris generator<ephemeris_gen>`, the generator will apply a circular search region around each filed pointing when associating potential input population detections with the survey observations. 


SNR/Apparent Magnitude Filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::
    These filters are for the advanced user. If you only want to know what the survey will discover, you **DO NOT** need these filters on.

These two mutually exclusive filters serve to cut observations of faint objects.
The user may either implement the SNR limit, to remove all observations of objects
below a user-defined SNR threshold; or the magnitude limit, to remove all observations
of objects above a user-defined **trailed source magnitude** threshold. 
**These filters are applied before the detection efficiency (fading function) is applied in** ``Sorcha``. 

The SNR filter which will remove synthetic observations that are less than a user-supplied SNR limit, To implement the SNR limit (in this example to keep synthetic observations of input objects with a SNR > =2) include the following in the config file::

    [EXPERT]
    SNR_limit = 2.0

To implement the magnitude limit (remove detections of objects fainter than 22 mag in all survey observing bands), include the following in the :ref:`configs`::
    
    [EXPERT]
    magnitude_limit = 22.0
    
.. attention::
    Only one of these filters may be implemented at once.

.. seealso::
  We have an `example Jupyter notebook <notebooks/demo_MagnitudeAndSNRCuts.ipynb>`_ demonstrating how these filters work within ``Sorcha``.


Faint Object Culling Filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This filter automatically drops objects from the user's input model that will never be detectable 
within the LSST before ephemeris generation begins. This has the benefit of potentially massively 
speeding up simulations by removing the overhead of ephemeris generation for these unobservable
objects.

The filter calculates a maximum apparent trailed source magnitude in each survey observing filter (with any relevant
activity or light curve brightness modifiers) per object, and checks if all of them are brighter than
2 + the faintest survey observation per respective filter (as obtained from the pointing database). If
the object is fainter in **all** filters, then it is dropped and not simulated further.

.. note::
    This filter is only approximate, and is not applied to objects with a perihelion distance *q* < 2 au. The calculations assume the Earth is on a circular orbit
    in order to compute the geocentric distance.


To implement the faint object culling filter, include the following in the :ref:`configs`::

    [EXPERT]
    brute_force = False

.. attention::
    This filter will, by default, be turned off (brute_force = True), within ``Sorcha`` generating ephemerides for every object of an input population.

.. note::
    This filter is only approximate, and is not applied to objects with a perihelion distance *q* < 2 au. The calculations assume the Earth is on a circular orbit
    in order to compute the geocentric distance.


Modifying the Ephemeris Generator Interpolation
--------------------------------------------------

A user can update the number of sub-intervals for the Lagrange ephemerides interpolation used within ``Sorcha``'s internal ephemeris generator. By default, this value is set to **101**, but the user can update it to a different value. 101 works for most orbits, but it may be worth exploring using a different value if you're modeling Earth impactors and very close Near-Earth Objects (NEOs). To change the number of sub-intervals, **ar_n_sub_intervals** variable is added to the ([SIMULATION]) section::

    [SIMULATION]
    ar_n_sub_intervals = 122

   
.. note::
    For most use cases this parameter will not need to be changed from the default value ``Sorcha`` uses. 


Specifying Alternative Versions of the Auxiliary Files Used in the Ephemeris Generator 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For backwards compatibility and to enable new version of the files to be run as well, users can override the default filenames and download locations of the :ref:`auxiliary files<auxfiles>` used by ``Sorcha``'s built-in :ref:`ephemeris generator<ephemeris_gen>`.  These :ref:`configs`: variables are added to a new auxiliary ([AUXILIARY]) section::


    [AUXILIARY]
    planet_ephemeris = de440s.bsp
    planet_ephemeris_url = https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/spk/planets/de440s.bsp

    earth_predict = earth_200101_990827_predict.bpc
    earth_predict_url = https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/pck/earth_200101_990827_predict.bpc

    earth_historical = earth_620120_240827.bpc
    earth_historical_url = https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/pck/earth_620120_240827.bpc

    earth_high_precision = earth_latest_high_prec.bpc
    earth_high_precision_url = https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/pck/earth_latest_high_prec.bpc

    jpl_planets = linux_p1550p2650.440
    jpl_planets_url = https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/ftp/eph/planets/Linux/de440/linux_p1550p2650.440

    jpl_small_bodies = sb441-n16.bsp
    jpl_small_bodies_url = https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/ftp/eph/small_bodies/asteroids_de441/sb441-n16.bsp 

    leap_seconds = naif0012.tls
    leap_seconds_url = https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/lsk/naif0012.tls

    meta_kernel = meta_kernel.txt
    
    observatory_codes = ObsCodes.json
    observatory_codes_compressed = ObsCodes.json.gz
    observatory_codes_compressed_url = https://minorplanetcenter.net/Extended_Files/obscodes_extended.json.gz

    orientation_constants = pck00010.pck
    orientation_constants_url = https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/pck/pck00010.tpc


.. note::
   You can specify one or any number of the filenames or URLs. 
 
.. note::
   If you make changes to the filenames or the download URLs, you'll likely need to first remove meta_kernel.txt from the auxiliary cache (the directory these files are stored in) or specify a different filename name for meta_kernel file in the config file so that it can be rebuilt with the appropriate names.  

.. note:: 
   ``Sorcha`` checks if the :ref:`auxiliary files<auxfiles>` exist in the cache directory first before attempting to download any missing files and copies them over into the default filenames. 
   
Advanced Output Options
-----------------------------------

Custom Outputs 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By setting the value of the output_columns configuration file keyword to a comma-separated list of column names, you may
specify your own custom output, using this page as a reference for potential column names.

For example, you could state this in your configuration file to get the object ID, position and magnitude only::

    [OUTPUT]
    output_columns = ObjID,RA_deg,Dec_deg,trailedSourceMag

.. warning::
   If you are choosing to specify the column names in this way, please perform a quick test-run first to ensure your column names are correct before
   embarking on any long runs. As we allow for user-written code and add-ons to add new column names, we do not error-handle the column names until
   late in the code, upon output.


Specifying the Decimal Precision for the Photometric and Astrometric Values 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, no rounding is performed on any of the output values. We recommend that you do not change the decimal place precision and instead leave ``Sorcha`` to output the full value to machine precision, but there may be reasons why you need to reduce the size of the output.

In the [OUTPUT] section of the :ref:`configs`, you can set the decimal precision for the astrometry outputs::

    [OUTPUT]
    # Decimal places to which RA and Dec should be rounded to in output.
    position_decimals = 7


In the [OUTPUT] section of the :ref:`configs`, you can set the decimal precision for the magnitude outputs::

    [OUTPUT]
    # Decimal places to which all magnitudes should be rounded to in output.
    magnitude_decimals = 3
