Welcome to Solar System Survey Simulator Post Processing's documentation!
=========================================================================
Welcome to the Solar System Survey Simulator Post Processing documentation. The survey simulator is a 
Python package for studying Solar System object population statistics. It has been designed 
with the `Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) <https://www.lsst.org>`_ in mind but can be adapted to be used with any survey.


This documentation webpage contains an installation guide and an overview of how the survey simulator 
works. Tutorials are provided which give examples on how to determine if an object is on a field of view, 
if it is observable with LSST, and specific guides for near earth objects, Jupiter trojans, cometary objects etc.

.. warning::
   This documentation site and the software packages it describes are under active development. Validation is still on-going. DO NOT USE this for science purposes just yet.
 
.. seealso::
   We have a summary paper (currently in prep) that provides and a broad summary of the software and with significant detail in the methodolgy behind in it. This documentation covers some of the same material but dives deeper into how to install and how to run simulations of what LSST would discover given a model population of synthetic Solar System bodies and a given pointing history for the survey.
