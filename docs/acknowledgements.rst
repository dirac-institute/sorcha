Several functions within ``Sorcha`` were adapted from code originally developed for  `rubin_sim <https://github.com/lsst/rubin_sim>`_, We thank the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Data Management Team and Scheduler Team for making their software open-source. Development of  ``rubin_sim`` was supported in part by the National Science Foundation through Cooperative Agreement AST-1258333 and Cooperative Support Agreement AST1836783 managed by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), and the Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC02-76SF00515 with the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory managed by Stanford University.
