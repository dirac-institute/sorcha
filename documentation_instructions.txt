How to document functions:

Each function should be in the python docstring format, i.e. between two sets of triple hyphens

TBD: The goal is for all documentation is to be automatically compiled to readthedoc format
with sphinx. So some hooks need to be checked and added.

Each function should contain the following information:


1. Name of the function
2. Author: [NAME OF AUTHOR]
3. Usage: A self-contained brief description of what the function is supposed to do. It should
include the information of input/output, what data is manipulated and how.
4. Input: Description of mandatory and optional input
5. Output: Description of output
6. Usage: Example usage of the function in a recipe.
