  sorcha is a survey simulator post-processing layer
  built for the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time.
  With this code, the user is able to create a synthetic
  Solar System small body population and run them through
  the Survey Simulator, which applies the specific
  observational biases from the LSST. In this way, a
  synthetic population can be compared to real LSST
  observations. The Survey Simulator is formed of two Python
  packages working in tandem. The first part is an
  ephemerides generator. While the user can use any relevant
  ephemerides generator, we recommend using Objects in Field
  (OIF) package for this. The second piece of software is
  Post Processing (sorcha), which applies the relevant
  observational biases to simulate what would be detected by
  LSST, using what we have called filters.
