## developer best practices
* Data sets should be moved to the `src/sorcha/modules/data` folder, have a readme.txt or readme.md to explain where the data came from as well as a time stamp in the readme.txt.
* Data sets that are used for unit testing should live in `tests/data`.  
* All required input files for the main software or unit tests should have extensions that clearly describe the file format (e.g. .csv, .txt, .db, .fits)
* If you are working on addressing a specific issue ticket, assign yourself the ticket.
* When making a pull request that closes an issue, cite the issue ticket in the pull request summary
* Docstrings should follow the [NumPy style](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) 

## Collaboration
This effort is a collaboration between Queen's University Belfast, the University of Washington's DiRAC Institute, 
the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian, and LINCC Frameworks (through the LINCC Frameworks Incubator Program).

This project is supported in part by the generosity of Eric and Wendy Schmidt by recommendation of the Schmidt Futures program.
