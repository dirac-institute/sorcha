RECIPES FOR POSTPROCESSING

The main pointing simulation is done by the oif (objectsInField) programme.

Each postprocessing task is separate, done within a single pandas dataframe.

The recipe is a python file containing a sequence of post-processing tasks. Each 
post-processing task is documented. You can write your own post-processing tasks.

The first task in the recipe ('read') is compulsory. Besides the output from oif, it can
include additional data fields, such as magnitudes and colours.

All other tasks in the recipe are optional, and are called in the order they appear in the recipe.

Sample recipes are included in the 'recipes' folder.
