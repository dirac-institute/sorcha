[INPUTFILES]

# When full pipeline will work, here will be the orbit input file [des format]

# orbit input file
orbinfile= ./data/test/testorb.des

# intermediate input file (oif output file)
oifoutput= ./data/test/oiftestoutput

# colour input file
colourinput= ./data/test/testcolour

# pointing database
pointingdatabase= ./data/test/baseline_10yrs_10klines.db

#### GENERAL PARAMETERS ####


[FILTERS]

# The main filter in the colour file to which all other colours are compared
mainfilter = r

# other colours with respect to the main filter, e.g g-r, should be given separated by comma.
othercolours= g-r,i-r

# resulting filters; main filter, followed by resolved colours, such as, e.g. 'r'+'g-r'='g'
# should be given in the following order: main filter, resolved filters in the same order
# as respective other colours. Should be separated by comma.
resfilters= r,g,i

[FILTERINGPARAMETERS]


# SSP detection efficiency: default == 0.95. Which fraction of the detections will
# the automated solar system processing pipeline recognise?

# Fraction of detector surface area which contains CCD -- simulates chip gaps
# default = 0.9

# length of trackets: default == 2. How many observations during one night are required to produce 
# a valid tracklet? 
minTracklet = 2

# Number of tracklets for detection: ndefault == 3. How many tracklets are required
# to classify as a detection?
noTracklets = 3

# Interval of tracklets (days): default + 15.0 (days). In what amount of time does the aforementioned
# number of tracklets needs to be discovered to constitute a complete detection?

# two images to recognise the motion between images (default == 0.5)
