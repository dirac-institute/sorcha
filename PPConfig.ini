[INPUTFILES]

# When full pipeline will work, here will be the orbit input file [des format]

# orbit input file
orbinfile= ./data/test/testorb.des

# intermediate input file (oif output file)
oifoutput= ./data/test/oiftestoutput

# colour input file

#### GENERAL PARAMETERS ####


[FILTERS]

# The main filter in the colour file to which all other colours are compared
mainfilter = r

# other colours with respect to the main filter, e.g g-r, should be given separated by comma.
othercolours= g-r,i-r

# resulting filters; main filter, followed by resolved colours, such as, e.g. 'r'+'g-r'='g'
# should be given in the following order: main filter, resolved filters in the same order
# as respective other colours. Should be separated by comma.
resfilters= r,g,i

# Number of tracklets for detection: ndefault == 3. How many tracklets are required
# to classify as a detection?
