# Sorcha Configuration File
# This configuration file is appropriate for running Sorcha using the full camera footprint 
# but with randomization, fading function, vignetting, SSP linking, saturation limit and 
# trailing losses off. This will output all detections which lie on the CCD with unadulterated 
# apparent magnitudes. This could thus be used to predict when and where known objects will appear 
# in Rubin observations. 
# WARNING: This configuration file turns off most of Sorcha's features,
# We do not recommend you use this unless you know what you are doing.
