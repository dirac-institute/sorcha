    Parameters
    -----------
    observations : Pandas dataframe
        dataframe of observations.

    phasefunction : string
        Desired phase function model. Options are HG, HG12, HG1G2, linear, none

    mainfilter : string
        The main filter in which H is given and all colour offsets are calculated against.

    othercolours : list of strings
        List of colour offsets present in input files.

    observing_filters : ist of strings
        List of observation filters of interest.

    cometary_activity_choice : string
        Choice of cometary activity model.
        Default = None

    lc_choice : string
        Choice of lightcurve model. Default =  None

    verbose : boolean
        Flag for turning on verbose logging. Default = False

    Returns
    ----------
    observations : Pandas dataframe
        Modified observations pandas dataframe with calculated trailed source
        apparent magnitude column, H calculated in relevant filter (H_filter),
        renames the column for H in the main filter as H_original and
        adds a column for the light curve contribution to the trailed source
        apparent magnitude (if included)
