[INPUT]

# Paths of input files (orbits, physical parameters, cometary, ephemeris
# simulation output) are given at the command line with the following flags:
# -c or --config                Configuration file name (this file)
# -m or --comet                 Comet parameter file name (optional)
# -p or --params                Physical parameters file name
# -o or --orbit                 Orbit file name
# -e or --ephem                 Ephemeris simulation output file name (i.e. OIF output)
 
# The simulation used for the ephemeris input.
# Options: currently only oif (objectsInField)

# database, this will be ignored.
# Options: csv, whitespace, hdf5

[ACTIVITY]

# Flag for cometary activity. If not none, a cometary parameters file must be specified at the command line.
# Options: none, comet

[FILTERS]

# Filters of the observations you are interested in, comma-separated.
# Your physical parameters file must have H calculated in one of these filters

[SATURATION]

# counts above the non-linearity regime of the pixels where one can’t do 
# photometry. Objects brighter than this limit (in magnitude) will be cut. 
# Comment out for no saturation limit.

# Single float: applies same saturation limit to observations in all filters.
# Comma-separated list of floats: applies saturation limit per filter, in order as
# given in observing_filters keyword.

# file must contain the columns needed to calculate the phase function.

# -u or --outfile               Output file path.
# -t or --stem                  Output file stem.

# Output format. The 'separatelycsv' option saves output into separate CSVs for each object.
# Options: csv, separatelycsv, sqlite3, hdf5
